Objective: Get to the town as fast as possible
- Can't bee line to the town because the bosses blocking the town has 15 strength, with the player starting at 10 strength
- Player can increase strength by exploring and finding chest
	- There are two types of chests; potions and inventory
	- The inventory chest contains a sword upgrade (increases strength by 2) and an armour upgrade (increases health by 2)
	- The potions chest contains a health potion (increases health by 1), a strength potion (increases strength by 1) and a speed potion (increases speed by 1)

- The idea behind this game is that multiple people can play
- The game has a highschore at the end
- Their time is their score
- The time it takes for the player to type also gets taken into account so to some extent, it has a typing minigame
- The player can also choose to fight or run away from the monster
	- The player must get a random roll higher than the monster strength to kill the monster, but they can decide to fight again until they run out of health
	- The player must get a random roll higher than the monster speed to successfully run from the monster, if not, they lose 2 health
- The player must balance between exploring the game and trying to get to the town as quick as possible
- The player must also be careful when deciding which item to take from the chest, because once they take an item, the chest disappears
- The player must fight the alpha wolf to get the 10+ health potion
- Once the player has discovered a grid, they cannot replay it again
